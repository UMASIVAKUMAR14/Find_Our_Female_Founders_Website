      <p class= "abouttext" >The likelihood of female businesses to receive funding has tripled in the past 15 years, but still only 7% investor money goes to women-led startups. You can learn more about the problem so as an investor, you can make more informed choices. You can also support funding bases such as Women for Tech and the Female Founder Fund that women in business can take advantage of.
